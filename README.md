## Description

So, you're this awesome developer and you need to code up a project. How do you do it?

Are you maybe doing one of these depending on your skill-level:

* Just throwing it up on server and using FTP or SFTP to code remotely?
* Using annoying software like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP?
* Configuring a virtual machine manually and trying to connect to it?
* Using some sort of localhost configuration direct on your machine and don't really even know what's going on?
